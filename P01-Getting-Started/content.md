You are an owner of an **Autoshop** and you would like to know some information about your Customers, Employees, Departments as well as the Cars you sell. All of these information is located in a database consisting of 4 tables : **Customers**, **Employees**, **Departments**, and **Cars**. In order to answer the questions you have, we are going to use SQL commands and query your database. 😄🗂



# What is SQL? 🤔
Structured Query language (SQL) is pronounced as “S-Q-L” or sometimes as “See-Quel”  which is the standard language for dealing with Relational Databases. SQL is effectively used to insert, search, update, delete and modify database records. It doesn’t mean SQL cannot do things beyond that. In fact, it can do a lot more other things as well.

You will be working on an **Autoshop database**. This database consists of 4 tables: **Customers**, **Employees**, **Departments**, and **Cars**.

You will be using **SQL Fiddle** platform to use sql commands and return the results you want.
